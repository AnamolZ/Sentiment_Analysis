      "Review: This truly was a book I didn‚Äôt want to put down and thought I had it all figured out but I was so wrong. It really had a twist towards the end. The main character Erika Cass had a pretty good life except her son was different from others. She‚Äôs known this all along and has tried to keep him and others safe from him. When a girl her son likes goes missing, she right away assumes he‚Äôs the one who did it. It also appears the police and community feel this same. The book is written in each chapter either by a character or an interview about the event of the missing girl. I‚Äôm not saying anymore because it really has a great twist. A super good read.Read more\n",

      "Review: I have read numerous novels by this author lately because she knows how to draw you into the story and just when you think it is going one way, there is always various twists and turns so that when you think you have figured out the theme, you find out you were wrong.Since I have a background in law enforcement, and I have handled many cases involving psychopathic criminals, and I found this book to be a fascinating read.  I was also able to figure out who was the guilty party; nevertheless, I never give away too much information when reviewing any novel.  If you enjoy reading the psychological theme novels by Freida McFadden, you should checkout this one. I found it to be a real page turner.Rating: 5 Stars.  Joseph J.

      "Review: The Perfect Sonby Freida McFadden4/5 ‚≠êÔ∏èLife is perfect for Erika Cass- a beautiful family, home, and low-stress job. Until she gets a knock on the door from two detectives. A high-school girl is missing and the last person to see this girl alive was Erika‚Äôs son, Liam.Erika loves Liam unconditionally but has known since kindergarten that he has a dark side. Now in high school, Liam seems like the perfect son- well-mannered, smart, and involved at school. Erika wants to believe he is innocent but her heart is filled with doubt. On top of Liam‚Äôs troubles, Erika‚Äôs mother confesses that she has been lying to Erika for years. The father who Erika thought was dead is actually in jail for murder. Could this be the root of Liam‚Äôs dark side? Can Erika sift through all the lies and figure out the truth before it is too late for this missing girl?The Perfect Son was another great thriller by McFadden. I enjoyed the mix of storytelling and the transcribed police interviews. Freida's writing is always amazing! She has a way of tricking me into thinking both the best and the worst about all the characters. Erica, the main character, is very relatable but her unconditional love for her children, especially her son plants seeds of doubt in your head. Unfortunately, I was able to figure out the main twist halfway through the book. Although the epilogue was surprisingly entertaining even after everything was revealed. If you are looking for an entertaining, fast-paced thriller this is the book for you.Read more\n",
